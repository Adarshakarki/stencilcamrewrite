**StencilCam** is a lightweight mobile utility designed to make creative photography effortless. It allows users to overlay guides, stencils, or templates directly on the camera view, making it easy to capture precise compositions every time.

### Features

* **Real-time Camera Overlay** – Place guides or templates directly on the live camera feed.
* **Interactive Stencils** – Move, rotate, and scale overlays to fit your composition.
* **Seamless Integration** – Works on both iOS and Android devices.
* **Lightweight and Fast** – Optimized for smooth performance on most devices.
* **Minimalist Design** – Clean interface focused on the creative experience.

**Purpose:**
StencilCam is designed for photographers, artists, and content creators who want to quickly and accurately frame shots, trace designs, or experiment with layouts in real time.

**Inspiration:**
Your friend takes a perfect photo of you, then hands you the phone to take the exact same one of them. You try to match it, but it just doesn't look the same. You're left feeling like the "bad photographer" because you can't recreate their vision.

**The Solution:** This app lets them set their shot as a transparent overlay. You don't have to be a pro; you just line them up with the "ghost" and click. No more pressure, no more bad photos.
